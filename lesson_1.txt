How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

The diff command pointed out the lines that had changed.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Can see how things changed over time.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Manually means more control (good).
But also means one can forget (bad).


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is meant to track a global package of files, whilst Google Docs is oriented at single documents.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

duh.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

It is fairly easy to go back to a previous version.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Nothing.
